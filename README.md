# Cosmic on Void
Big thanks to [Calandracas606](https://github.com/Calandracas606), I used their work as a base
## Install Cosmic
### Install via Rpeository
> There is only a Repo for x86_64 Systems
1. `echo 'repository=https://mtfbella109.github.io/void-cosmic-repo/repo/x86_64' | sudo tee /etc/xbps.d/10-cosmic.conf`
2. `sudo xbps-install -S`
3. Install single components with `sudo xbps-install -S <package_name>` or install all components, with `sudo xbps-install -S cosmic-desktop` 

## Install and build via xbps-src
1. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MtFBella109/void-packages.git`
2. `cd void-packages`
3. `./xbps-src binary-bootstrap`
4. You can build single components with `./xbps-src pkg <package_name>` or build every component with `./xbps-src pkg cosmic-desktop`
5. Install the package with `xi <package_name>` or with `xbps-install --repository hostdir/binpkgs <package_name>`
   > Note: You get the xi command with the package xtools
7. If you want to use the all settings in Power&Battery, you need to enable power-profile daemon with this command: `sudo ln -s /etc/sv/power-profiles-daemon /var/service/`

## Cosmic-greeter
Cosmic-greeter doesn't work. I couldn't figure out why, for me It seems like, that it has something to with pam and/or elogind. Unfortunately I don't have enough knowledge on how to debug or fix this.
The cosmic-greeter Package is becasue of that marked as broke and isn't on the cosmic-desktop metapackage for now
