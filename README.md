## Install Cosmic
### Install via Repository | The Repo is currently not available, I'm working on it to fix it
> There is only a Repo for x86_64 Systems
1. If you haven't installed mesa-dri, please do it with: `sudo xbps-install -S mesa-dri`. *ATTENTION: If you have a NVIDIA Graphic card, you need mesa-dri too, cosmic doesn't start, without mesa-dri, you can of course install also the nvidia driver, that isn't a Problem*
2.  Add Reposiotry
   - glibc: `echo 'repository=https://bellawagner.de/repo/x86_64' | sudo tee /etc/xbps.d/59-cosmic.conf`
   - musl: `echo 'repository=https://bellawagner.de/repo/x86_64-musl' | sudo tee /etc/xbps.d/59-cosmic.conf` 
4. Update Package list: `sudo xbps-install -S`
5. Install single components with `sudo xbps-install -S <package_name>` or install all components, with `sudo xbps-install -S cosmic-desktop`
6. Optional, but recomended install firefox and sddm with `sudo xbps-install -S firefox sddm`

## Install and build via xbps-src
1. If you haven't install graphic drivers on your system do `sudo xbps-install -S nvidia mesa-dri` for nvidia and `sudo xbps-install -S mesa-dri` for other GPU's
2. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MtFBella109/void-packages.git`
3. `cd void-packages`
4. `./xbps-src binary-bootstrap`
5. You can build single components with `./xbps-src pkg <package_name>` or build every component with `./xbps-src pkg cosmic-desktop`
6. Install the package with `xi <package_name>` or with `xbps-install --repository hostdir/binpkgs <package_name>`
   > Note: You get the xi command with the package xtools
7. Optional, but recomended install firefox and sddm with `sudo xbps-install -S firefox sddm`
