## Cosmic-greeter
Cosmic-greeter doesn't work. I couldn't figure out why, for me It seems like, that it has something to with pam and/or elogind. Unfortunately I don't have enough knowledge on how to debug or fix this.
The cosmic-greeter Package is becasue of that marked as broke and isn't on the cosmic-desktop metapackage for now
